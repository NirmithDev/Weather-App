# Hi There âœ‹

## This is a project about Weather app -> a beginner's project of including js to the front end side

### The Api -> can be accessed through open weather API I will include mine as of now just for your testing purposes

- In this project there is not much to look at but I suggest getting the inital page set up on what you would want yours to look like 

- After that start by adding a little bit of functionality and seeing if the API is active

- After it is active start trying to access and get the little details baby steps -> such as when user inputs something such as say manama it must return the city manama and country name

- then the over writing of the values using innerHTML of JS DOM manipulation whatever you want to call it

- In the end you can decide on what ya want it to look like so yeah go crazy

- Project Demo
